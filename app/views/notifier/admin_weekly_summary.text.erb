Last week, there were <%= @num_logs %> scheduled pick-ups.
We have data entered for <%= @num_entered %> of those.

We picked up /at least/ <%= @lbs %> pounds of food. 

The biggest pickup was <%= @biggest.weight %> lbs, done by <%= @biggest.volunteer.name %>
from <%= @biggest.donor.name %> to <%= @biggest.recipient.name %> on <%= @biggest.when.strftime('%A') %>.

<% if @flagged_logs.length > 0 %>
These logs were flagged for us:

<% @flagged_logs.each{ |l| %>
<%= l.volunteer.name %> (<%= [l.volunteer.email,l.volunteer.phone].compact.join(",") %>)
<%= l.donor.name %> -> <%= l.recipient.name %> on <%= l.when %> for <%= l.weight %> lbs
Description: <%= word_wrap(l.description,70) %>
Note: <%= word_wrap(l.notes,:line_width => 70) %>

  <% } %>
<% end %>
