Hi there,

This is a friendly reminder from the BFR robot that you need to enter
some data for your recent pickup:

<%= @log.when %>: <%= @log.donor.name %> to <%= @log.recipient.name %>

Here's a direct link to enter the data:

http://localhost:3002/logs/<%= @log.id %>/edit

This is your <%= @log.num_reminders.ordinalize %> reminder.

Thanks!
