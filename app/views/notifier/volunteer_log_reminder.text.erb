Hi <%= @volunteer.name %>,

This is a friendly reminder from the BFR robot that you need to enter
some data for your recent pickup<%= @logs.length > 1 ? "s" : "" %>:

<% @logs.each{ |l| %>
<%= l.when %>: <%= l.donor.name %> to <%= l.recipient.name %> (<%= l.food_type.nil? ? "Produce/Baked Goods" : l.food_type.name %>)
Link: http://alpha.boulderfoodrescue.org/logs/<%= l.id %>/edit
This is your <%= l.num_reminders.ordinalize %> reminder.

<% } %>
Thanks!
